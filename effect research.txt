each entry in the array of effect strings (used by the game to access effect files) is 58 bytes long 
the array is constant, as mint scripts predict whatever is in the array but it's also heap allocated.
known offsets:
	arr[0x5c] - CommonAbilityGet

But we're not done yet, I need to how know this array gets set up, and how the effects work.
